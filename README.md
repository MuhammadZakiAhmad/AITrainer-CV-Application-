Title: AI-Based Fitness Trainer: Real-time Exercise Monitoring and Repetition Counting

Description:
I am excited to share a project I've been working on that combines computer vision and artificial intelligence to create a real-time fitness trainer. Using the power of machine learning and the Mediapipe library, I have developed a system capable of detecting and tracking human poses during specific exercises.

The system utilizes a webcam to capture video input, and through the application of pose estimation algorithms, it can identify key joints and landmarks on the user's body. By analyzing the positions of these landmarks over time, the system can accurately determine the execution of different exercises.

The project currently supports three exercises: Bicep Curls, Overhead Press, and Declined Tricep Curls. For each exercise, the system provides real-time feedback, including the angle formed by the relevant joints and the stage of the exercise (e.g., up or down). Additionally, it tracks the number of repetitions completed, offering a comprehensive monitoring and feedback system.

The application utilizes the popular computer vision library OpenCV for video processing and visualization. It leverages the capabilities of the Mediapipe library, specifically the Pose module, which provides accurate pose estimation and tracking.

This project demonstrates the potential of AI in the fitness domain. By combining computer vision and machine learning, we can create personalized trainers that offer real-time feedback, enhancing exercise performance and reducing the risk of injury. Moreover, the system can serve as a valuable tool for fitness enthusiasts, trainers, and physical therapists, enabling remote monitoring and analysis of exercise routines.

I believe this project showcases my skills in computer vision, machine learning, and software development. It demonstrates my ability to leverage existing libraries and frameworks to create innovative solutions. I am excited to apply my expertise to further advancements in the fields of AI-based fitness training and human motion analysis.

If you would like to learn more about this project or discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out. I am eager to explore opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to the development of cutting-edge technologies in the fitness and healthcare domains.
